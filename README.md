# Predicting River Flow in Atacama Region Watersheds

This is a repository that hosts all code for my master thesis about predicting river flow in the Atacama Region of Chile using various features derived from e.g. sattelite products.

## Installation 
To run the various scripts in this repository please use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to create a virtual environment that contains all packages needed to run the code in this project. For this you can use the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock, instructions for using Pipenv can be found [here](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html).
